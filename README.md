## The Problem: The "Deep End" Liquidity Crisis
The venture capital model is currently facing a historic liquidity logjam. For funds from the 2016–2019 vintages, **65% to 90% of returns remain unmonetized**. 

While the industry solved the *entry* friction with the **SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)**, the *exit* process remains stuck in the dark ages. Small-ticket secondary transfers (e.g., an early employee selling $50k of stock) are currently plagued by:
* **High Legal Costs:** Custom SPAs cost more than the spread of the trade.
* **Administrative Friction:** Companies block transfers due to ROFR/Co-Sale complexity.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Buyers lack standardized diligence data.

## The Solution: The SALE Protocol
The **SALE (Simple Agreement for Liquidity Exit)** is an open-source standard designed to streamline secondary liquidity. It is a unified instrument that functions as a:
1.  **Purchase Agreement** (with standardized pricing/discounts).
2.  **Waiver of ROFR** (pre-baked for the Company).
3.  **Universal Joinder** (binding the Buyer to existing Voting/IRA agreements).

### Key Features
* **"Flow-Through" Closing:** Funds settle *through* the Company, ensuring the Cap Table is updated before money is released (solving the "phantom closing" risk).
* **The "Big Boy" Waiver:** Mandatory acknowledgement of information asymmetry to protect Sellers and Companies from litigation.
* **Administrative Fee:** A standard $2,500 fee payable to the Company to cover the cost of execution.

## How to Use This
1.  **Download** the `SALE_v2.0_Standard.docx` from this repository.
2.  **Fill in the Variables:**
    * **Reference Price:** (e.g., Last 409A or Last Preferred Round).
    * **Discount:** (e.g., 20%).
3.  **Execute:** Sign via DocuSign. The Company acts as the final signatory and Paying Agent.
