## The Problem: The "Deep End" Liquidity Crisis
For venture funds from the 2016–2019 vintages, **65% to 90% of returns remain unmonetized**. 
While the industry solved the *entry* friction with the **SAFE**, the *exit* process for small-ticket secondaries (e.g., an early employee selling $50k of stock) is broken:
* **High Legal Costs:** Custom SPAs often cost $5k–$10k, eating up the spread on small trades.
* **Administrative Friction:** Companies block transfers to avoid the hassle of ROFR waivers and board consents.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Sellers lack the diligence data Buyers demand.

## The Solution: The SALE Protocol
The **SALE (Simple Agreement for Liquidity Exit)** is an open-source standard designed to streamline secondary liquidity. It functions as a unified:
1.  **Purchase Agreement** (with standardized pricing/discounts).
2.  **Deemed Joinder** (automatically binding the Buyer to existing Voting/IRA agreements).
3.  **Waiver Mechanism** (designed to pair with a pre-approved Board Policy).

### Key Features
* **Direct Settlement:** Buyers pay Sellers directly, reducing Company liability.
* **The "Big Boy" Waiver:** Mandatory acknowledgement of information asymmetry to protect the Company from litigation.
* **Administrative Fee:** A standardized $2,500 fee payable to the Company to incentivize fast processing.

## How to Use This
1.  **Download** the `SALE_v1.0.docx`.
2.  **Fill in the Variables:** Reference Price (e.g., Last 409A), Discount (e.g., 20%), and Admin Fee Payer.
3.  **Execute:** The Company signs *solely* to confirm the waiver and update the cap table.
